**Why host a call?** We wanted to add another channel for regular project updates and a chance to make our online connections a little more IRL. We have a unique community! We can pull speakers from friendly and interesting projects across multiple domains who may not cross paths but face similar challenges. It's a chance to bring the global community together to interact between conferences and meetups.

We support sevearl projects via fiscal sponsorship and are growing an awesome community of technology for the public good projects that span open data, open research, science, peer-to-peer web, and technology for the public good. Central to our mission to bringing people together from different fields to share ideas.
